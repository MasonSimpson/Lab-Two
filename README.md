***README FILE FOR LAB 4***

For lab four, I will be making adjustments to the event planner created for Lab Two. I plan on implementing the following design patterns:
- Strategy Pattern
- Factory Pattern

*Strategy Pattern*

I will be using the strategy pattern to allow sorting strategies in the EventListPanel dynamically. This will replace the hardcoded sort logic with a more modular approach. I will create a SortStrategy interface and then implement this interface within EventListPanel.

*Factory Pattern*

I will be using the factory pattern to create events dynamically using a custom EventFactory.java class.
